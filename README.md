Hello. Welcome to my project.
If you want to see my model data base, you can upload file "Models_DB.xml" in https://nosqldbm.ru

I create this project myself. Design was created in figma. All other written in vscode.
Used preprocess "scss" for styles and native JavaScript. When i started this project, i didn't know about XMLHttpRequest and Fech. For this reason there using ajax request.
